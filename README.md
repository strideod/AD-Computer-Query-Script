# AD-Computer-Query-Script
This PowerShell script imports a list of computer names from a CSV file, queries Active Directory (AD) for each computer, and writes specific properties (name, last logon date, and location) to a text file. It is designed to help system administrators quickly gather and record information about multiple computers registered in AD.
